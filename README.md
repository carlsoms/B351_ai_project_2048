Welcome to our AI final project github page! To run our program,
simply download all of the pyton files within this repository 
to your computer. Once this is done you can double-click the run.py
to run the program.(Will not work without Python installed on your
machine) From there you can select which AI to 
preview or to play the game manually with arrow keys.

The board class primarily is used to initialize board objects.Each 
Board contains Tile objects which are used to represent each Tile
on the overall game board. The game class has different functions
that change the way the tile and board classes are used to change 
the board. For example the game class contains functions for playing
the game manually, as well as functions for displaying the step-by-step
process of each AI. The run class is used to create a window for
users to interact with the code easily and change which way they want
to run the game. the setup class is used to convert the overall 
file into an executable so that it can be shared. Unfortunately, the
resulting executable and corresponding data is too big to upload here,
so conversion will have to be done on your machine.
