CSCI-B 351 Intro to Artificial Interlligence
2048 Solver

Welcome to our AI final project github page! To run our program,
simply download the "2048 Game.zip" folder and extract its
contents into a file on your computer. Once completed you should
be able to click the shortcut "2048 Solver" within the files
that were just extracted. From there you can select which AI to 
preview or to play the game manually with arrow keys.
